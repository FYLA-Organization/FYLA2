## 📱 Screen Integration Details

### ProviderStorefrontScreen Integration
```typescript
// Current mock data usage
const mockProvider = { /* fallback data */ };

// Ready for API integration
const loadStorefrontData = async () => {
  try {
    const provider = await ApiService.getCurrentUserProvider();
    setProviderData(provider);
  } catch (error) {
    // Fallback to mock data during development
    setProviderData(mockProvider);
  }
};
```

### EnhancedServiceManagementScreen Integration
```typescript
// Current mock data usage  
const mockServices = [/* fallback data */];

// Ready for API integration
const loadServices = async () => {
  try {
    const services = await ApiService.getProviderServices(providerId);
    setServices(services);
  } catch (error) {
    // Fallback to mock data during development
    setServices(mockServices);
  }
};
```

### ProviderAvailabilityScreen Integration
```typescript
// Current mock data usage
const mockAvailability = { /* fallback data */ };

// Ready for API integration
const loadAvailability = async () => {
  try {
    const availability = await ApiService.getProviderAvailability(providerId);
    setAvailability(availability);
  } catch (error) {
    // Fallback to mock data during development
    setAvailability(mockAvailability);
  }
};
```
